        "Doug McCracken and Joshua Lu\n",
        "We hear a lot of discussion around the best practices for launching a mobile game, and one particular topic that often comes up is: whether or not to do a soft launch. And if you do soft launch, how can you tell if your game will be successful? Much of the mobile games industry has taken the tactic of soft launching seriously – in September alone, there were more than 100 games soft launched on the Apple App Store and over 600 on the Google Play Store.\n",
        "This blog post will explore what a soft launch is and why it can be beneficial for game studios. We’ll also dispel some of the myths that are commonly associated with soft launches and help you figure out if this strategy is right for your game. We’ll also address why there are so many more games soft launched on Google Play (hint: they have more options to support a variety of soft launch strategies).\n",
        "What’s a Soft Launch?\n",
        "A soft launch (or sometimes “geo test” or “beta”) is when a game is released to a limited number of players before it is released worldwide, usually by releasing only to specific countries. This allows developers to test different aspects of the game, such as the gameplay, graphics, and economy in a real-world environment without the pressure of a full release. Soft launch enables player feedback and metrics which can be used to compare to benchmarks that both Apple’s iOS App Store and Google Play offer in their dashboards.\n",
        "There are typically two stages of soft launch: alpha and beta.\n",
        "Alpha is the earlier stage and is often used to test whether the core of the game is working, including the technology and core gameplay loop.\n",
        "Beta is later and is used to test the meta gameplay loop, marketing acquisition, server scalability, and monetization.\n",
        "Why is soft launch important to consider? Because you only get one shot at a first impression with most of your potential players and you want to make sure the game has the best possible shot at being successful when you launch globally. Mobile gamers are spoiled by choice and have a low propensity to return post-churn. We’ve seen that typically, it is between 5-10x more expensive to acquire a player who already quit than to acquire a new player.\n",
        "Additionally, distribution is one of the biggest challenges in mobile games – if your users don’t retain or monetize, you’ll have trouble scaling your game via organic growth or paid acquisition. By releasing the game in stages, developers can get valuable feedback from players that can help improve the game before it is released to everyone.\n",
        "Myths About Soft Launch\n",
        "Before we share more perspective on soft launch strategy, we wanted to dispel some common myths:\n",
        "The country or market chosen for the soft launch will accurately represent how the game will perform worldwide\n",
        "While it’s important to choose a market that closely aligns with your target demographics, it’s also important to keep in mind that every market is unique and may have different reactions to the game. For example, many developers choose Canada to test how a US launch would perform. In our experience, there are too many variables to accurately simulate a launch in another country, however, retention and monetization metrics compared to other regions can give you some directional understanding of performance.\n",
        "Soft launch can only be done on mobile platforms like iOS and Android\n",
        "Though the focus of this post is mobile, a soft launch strategy can also be applied to PC and console games. This can be especially useful for cross platform games to understand the dynamics of players on different platforms, and improve gameplay and performance.\n",
        "Soft launches are expensive\n",
        "The investment required for your soft launch is dependent on your goals for soft launch. If you have a strong understanding of your audience, you will be much more likely to target them via organic or paid means in a cost effective way.\n",
        "You need to soft launch a game for it to succeed\n",
        "Soft launch is a way to solicit player feedback before a broader global launch, but isn’t necessarily needed to be successful. We believe it is usually better to soft launch, but there are plenty of successful games that went straight to global launch.\n",
        "Resetting player progress after a soft launch will anger the community\n",
        "While some players will respond negatively if you reset their progress, many understand that this is the “price of admission” for accessing a game early. As long as you’re upfront with players that the test is limited to a certain number of days, they will understand when the test ends. For example, Supercell recently launched a “Limited Open Beta” to test their game Flood Rush (ultimately based on soft launch Supercell decided not to release globally). If you’re resetting player progress, it is a best practice to refund players who spend during soft launch (or at a minimum, give them the equivalent value of in-game currency to spend later).\n",
        "What Can you Learn from Soft Launch?\n",
        "There are a few questions you should seek to answer with a soft launch, though it’s difficult to answer all of these at a high level of fidelity. If you’re resource constrained, you should think about prioritizing your goals based on what’s most important to the team.\n",
        "Is the game stable/performant?\n",
        "Building a bug-free game is hard, and while your QA team is heroically finding and triaging bugs, there’s nothing like a soft launch to show you where the holes are. Acquiring users at scale from lower-cost geographies is a great way to stress test servers and also get performance data from long-tail devices. There are a TON of lower-spec Android phones that your QA team won’t have and should probably not be purchasing. Some metrics to keep in mind for this sort of testing include: FPS, crash rates/DAU, crashes/crasher, and latency.\n",

              "What do players think of the game?\n",
              "Player feedback is invaluable during a soft launch, and you can use it to improve the game before the full launch. You can collect feedback through surveys, focus groups, or forums.

              "Now that we’ve discussed why soft launching is important, let’s talk about how to do it. Here are some steps to follow:\n",
              "Step 1: Determine Your Goals\n",
              "Before you start planning your soft launch, you need to determine what you want to achieve. Do you want to test the game mechanics, monetization strategy, or player engagement? Knowing your goals will help you focus your testing and ensure that you get the right feedback.\n",
              "Step 2: Choose Your Platform\n",
              "Choose the platform that best suits your goals and target audience. For mobile games, Apple’s TestFlight and Google Play’s beta testing program are popular choices. PC and console games can use platforms like Steam Early Access or Xbox Game Preview.\n",
              "Step 3: Select Your Region\n",
              "Choose a region that is representative of your target audience. For mobile games, you can choose a country with a similar demographic to your target audience. For PC and console games, you can choose a region with a similar gaming culture.\n",
              "Step 4: Recruit Players\n",
              "Recruit players for your soft launch through social media, forums, or online communities. You can also use paid user acquisition channels like Facebook or Google Ads. Be sure to communicate clearly what the soft launch is and what players can expect.\n",
              "Step 5: Run Your Test\n",
              "Run your soft launch test, and collect data on player behavior, feedback, and performance. Be sure to monitor player engagement and retention to see how well your game is doing.\n",
              "Step 6: Analyze Your Data\n",
              "Analyze the data you collected during the soft launch and use it to make improvements to your game. Focus on areas where players provided negative feedback or where metrics were lower than expected.\n",
              "Step 7: Iterate and Refine\n",
              "Iterate and refine your game based on the feedback and data you collected. Make sure to address any major issues or areas of improvement.\n",
              "Step 8: Re-soft Launch or Go Global\n",
              "Once you’ve made improvements to your game, you can either re-soft launch to test the changes or go global with your release. If you’re happy with the game’s performance, it’s time to release it to the world.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "Soft launching is a crucial step for any game studio that wants to release a successful game. It gives you the chance to test your game in a real-world environment, gather feedback from players, and make improvements before the full launch. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your game is well-balanced, engaging, and monetizes well. Remember that soft launching is not a one-size-fits-all solution, so be sure to tailor your approach to your game’s unique needs and goals.</textarea>"

              "While it’s hard to measure the efficacy of your marketing before you’ve spent a lot of money, you can get a sense for how well it will perform by testing ads in a soft launch. You’ll be able to track metrics such as install rates, conversion rates, and retention.\n",
              "How do players enjoy the core and meta gameplay loops?\n",
              "Though you may have a good intuition for the core gameplay loop, you need to see if it resonates with your audience. Soft launch enables you to see how your audience is interacting with the game and whether it’s fun for them. You can also use this opportunity to see how players are interacting with the meta gameplay loop, such as how they’re progressing through the game and what their monetization patterns are. Some metrics to pay attention to here are: DAU/MAU, D1/D7/D30 retention, time to first session, time to first purchase, ARPDAU, and ARPPU.\n",

              "How Does the Google Play Store Compare to Apple’s App Store for Soft Launches?\n",
              "Google Play provides more options for soft launches due to its less restrictive policies. For example, Google allows developers to release games directly to the public without being reviewed first. Google also offers a program called “Early Access” that allows developers to monetize their game while still in development. This means that developers can get valuable feedback and revenue simultaneously.\n",
              "Apple, on the other hand, is much more restrictive. The company has strict guidelines that must be followed before a game can be released. For example, Apple requires developers to include a minimum number of features and levels before the game can be approved. This makes it harder for developers to release a game that’s not yet complete. Apple also doesn’t allow developers to monetize their game during a soft launch.\n",
              "It’s worth noting, however, that both stores have their own strengths. The App Store has a more curated feel, which can lead to more visibility for a game if it’s well-designed. Google Play, on the other hand, has more flexibility, which can be beneficial for developers who want to experiment with different monetization strategies.\n",
              "Conclusion: How to Choose the Right Soft Launch Strategy for Your Game\n",

              "First, it’s important to consider why you’re soft launching. Are you looking to test the game’s stability and performance? Are you trying to gauge player interest and retention? Or are you looking to test your marketing and monetization strategies? Once you know your goals, you can determine which metrics to track and how to allocate your resources.\n",
              "Next, consider your audience. Who are your target players, and where are they located? Choose a market that aligns with your target demographics so that you can get valuable feedback from players who will be representative of your broader audience.\n",
              "Finally, think about your budget. A soft launch doesn’t have to break the bank, but it does require some investment. Consider how you can reach your target players cost-effectively, whether through organic or paid means.\n",
              "Soft launching can be a valuable tool for game studios looking to test their game before a full release. By choosing the right strategy and tracking the right metrics, developers can improve their game’s chances of success and avoid costly mistakes.\n",
              "Soft launching is a way to solicit player feedback before a broader global launch, but it's not necessarily needed to be successful. However, it can help developers identify and fix issues before a full release and gauge player interest, retention, and monetization. There are two main stages of soft launch: alpha and beta, and developers should choose a market that aligns with their target demographics. Google Play offers more options for soft launches due to its less restrictive policies, while Apple's App Store has a more curated feel. The best soft launch strategy for a game will depend on the developer's</textarea>"

              "This is where your game’s design meets the player’s experience. It’s hard to predict what players will actually do in the wild and the data will surprise you. You’ll want to watch the first-session user experience and see where players are confused or frustrated. If your game has a gacha system, how do players react to it? Do they spend money on it? Do they get angry that they’re not getting the items they want? This is the first step to understanding how healthy your game’s economy is. Some metrics to keep in mind for this sort of testing include: day 1 retention, session length, user flow (where do players get stuck), and FTUE (first-time user experience).\n",
              "How will the game monetize? \n",
              "Soft launch is a great opportunity to see how your game will monetize in the real world. You can test different types of ads, IAPs, and subscription models. You can also see how different player segments respond to these monetization strategies and adjust accordingly. Some metrics to keep in mind for this sort of testing include: ARPDAU, ARPPU, conversion rates, and monetization-related KPIs.\n",
              "What to do after the soft launch?\n",
              "Once you’ve collected all the data from your soft launch, it’s time to make some decisions. The most important thing to do is to compare your soft launch KPIs to your benchmark KPIs to see if the game is on track. If not, it’s time to iterate and make changes. If the game is on track, then it’s time to start planning for the global launch.\n",
              "You’ll also want to take the time to analyze player feedback and make changes to the game based on the feedback you receive. This is also a great opportunity to work on localization and make sure the game is translated and culturally relevant for your target markets.\n",
              "Finally, it’s time to start building hype for the game. This can include creating trailers, social media accounts, and community pages. You can also start working on influencer partnerships and other marketing efforts to get the word out about your game.\n",
              "Soft launch has many advantages, but it’s not for everyone. Before you decide to soft launch, consider the following:\n",
              "1. Does your game have a strong core gameplay loop?\n",
              "2. Is your game’s technology stable?\n",
              "3. Do you have a good understanding of your target audience?\n",
              "4. Do you have the resources to support a soft launch?\n",
              "5. Are you willing to make changes to the game based on player feedback?\n",
              "If you answered yes to all of these questions, then a soft launch might be right for you.\n",
              "Conclusion \n",
              "Soft launching a game is an important strategy for mobile game developers. It allows them to test different aspects of the game in a real-world environment, get valuable feedback from players, and make changes to the game before it is released to everyone. While there are some myths surrounding soft launches, they can be beneficial for game studios if done correctly. By choosing the right country or market, setting clear goals, and being upfront with players, developers can ensure a successful soft launch and ultimately, a successful game launch.</textarea>"

              "It’s difficult to measure fun directly, but you can proxy for fun with metrics like retention and engagement. If you’re seeing high levels of retention and engagement, it’s likely that your game is fun. On the other hand, if retention and engagement are low, your game may not be fun enough. You can also survey players to get a better understanding of how they feel about the game.\n",
              "Can we monetize effectively? \n",
              "This is a big one – if your game doesn’t monetize, it’s not sustainable. Soft launch is a great way to test monetization strategies such as in-app purchases or ads. You can experiment with different pricing models or ad placements and see how they impact revenue. It’s a good idea to keep an eye on metrics like ARPDAU, ARPPU, and conversion rate to gauge the effectiveness of your monetization strategy.\n",
              "Is the game’s meta gameplay loop healthy?\n",
              "This is another important question to answer. You can have a great core gameplay loop, but if the meta gameplay loop (i.e. the long-term progression and strategy) isn’t compelling, players may lose interest quickly. A soft launch is a great opportunity to test the meta gameplay loop and see how players engage with it.\n",
              "What’s the best marketing message?\n",
              "Soft launch is a great time to test your marketing messaging and see what works best for your game. You can experiment with different ad creatives, social media posts, and website copy to see which ones resonate most with players.\n",
              "Soft launch can be a powerful tool for game studios, but it's important to keep in mind that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each game and audience is unique, so it's important to tailor your soft launch strategy to your specific needs and goals.\n",
              "In summary, a soft launch is a limited release of a game to a small number of players before a full launch. It allows developers to test different aspects of the game, such as gameplay and monetization, in a real-world environment. Soft launches can be beneficial for game studios because they allow for testing and feedback before a full launch, but they are not necessary for success. There are several myths associated with soft launches, such as the idea that the country chosen for the soft launch will accurately represent the game's performance worldwide, or that soft launches are expensive.\n",
              "Soft launches can help answer questions such as whether the game is stable and fun, if the monetization strategy is effective, and if the meta gameplay loop is healthy. It's important to choose the right market for the soft launch and to be upfront with players about the test's limitations.
